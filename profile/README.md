## üåü About Us
At **FITS AI**, we aim to empower healthier food choices by providing:
- üìä **Nutritional Insights**: Detailed nutritional facts for packaged food products.
- ü§ù **Personalized Health Analysis**: Tailored recommendations based on your allergies and health conditions, especially for people managing diabetes.
- üéØ **Health Grades**: Products are evaluated and graded from **A** (healthiest) to **D** (lowest) to make your decision-making effortless.

Our mission is to support healthier lifestyles through transparency and technology.
